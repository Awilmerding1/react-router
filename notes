Part One:
  Set up our react-router in the index.js file

  We wrap <App/> inside <BrowserRouter> which gives us the ability to
  use the Route component inside ANY component that is a CHILD of the App
  component

  Inside App, we set up a <Route /> for our HomePage component
  Note: We can ONLY use Route because the App component is wrapped inside
  BrowserRouter

Part Two:
  Move route to inside App.js file

  We change the index.js file so that it renders just App, unwrapped

  We then set up the BrowserRouter inside the App file and place a <Route/>
  inside that sets up a route to our FirstRoute component

Part Three:
  Add Link inside FirstRoute that links to SecondRoute

Part Four:
  Add Redirect
    <Redirect from='/' to='/firstroute'/>
  Add conditional Redirect
    {this.props.redirect ? <Redirect to='/firstroute'/> : null}

Part Five:
    <Route path="/secondroute" render={() => <SecondRoute/>}/>
    <Route path="/secondroute" component={() => <SecondRoute/>}/>

    <Route path="/secondroute" render={(props) => <SecondRoute {...props}/>}/>
    <Route path="/secondroute" component={(props) => <SecondRoute {...props}/>}/>



    {this.props.match.params !== '/pets' &&  this.props.match.params !== '/home' ? <Link to='/pets'>Pets</Link> : null}
